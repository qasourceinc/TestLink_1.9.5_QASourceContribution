<h1>Test Plan</h1>

{include file="nav.tpl"}

<h2>General</h2>

<p>It is possible that users may not see a dropdown containing any Test plans. 
In this situation all links (except lead enabled ones) will be unlinked. If you 
are in this situation you must contact a lead or admin to grant you the proper 
project rights or create a Test Plan for you.</p>


<h2>Test Execution</h2>

<p>This section is where users can execute test cases (write test results) and 
print Test case suite of the Test Plan. This section is where users can track 
the results of their test case execution.</p> 



<h2>Test Plan Management</h2>

<p>This section, which is only lead accessible, allows users to administrate test plans. 
Administering test plans involves creating/editing/deleting plans, 
adding/editing/deleting/updating test cases in plans, creating builds as well as defining who can 
see which plan.<br />
Users with lead permissions may also set the priority/risk and ownership of 
Test case suites (categories) and create testing milestones.</p>
