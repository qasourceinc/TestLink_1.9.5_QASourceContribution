<h1>Executing Test Cases</h1>

{include file="nav.tpl"}
<p>This page allows users to "execute" test cases. Execution itself is merely
assigning a test case a result (pass,fail,blocked) against a build. There are
two different flags that a user will see on the execution page.</p>

<h2>Update Test Case Suite</h2>
<p>Users will see the Update flag <img src='../../icons/flag.gif' /> if the
original version of the test case (on the management side) has been updated. If
users have the proper rights they can go to the update/delete test case page
either through clicking on the test case number next to the flag or through the
link on main page.<br />
Note:It is not necessary for users to update test cases if there has been a
change. They simply have the option of doing so if they wish.<br />
</p>

<h2>Delete Test Case Suite</h2>
<p>Users will see the "x" symbol <img src='../../icons/x-icon.gif' /> if the
original version of the test case (on the management side) has been deleted. If
users have the proper rights they can go to the update/delete test case page
either through clicking on the test case number next to the "x" or through the
link on main page.</p>
