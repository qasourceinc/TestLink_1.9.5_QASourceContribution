<h1>Test Filtering</h1>

{include file="nav.tpl"}
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>This table allows the user to filter test cases before they are executed.</p>

<h2>Ownership</h2>

<p>Users can filter test cases by their owner. Ownership is determined at 
the category level, is determined by leads, and can be changed at the Assign 
Risk and Ownership page under metrics.<br /> 

<h2>Keyword</h2>

<p>Users can filter test cases by keyword. Keywords are set either using the 
Create/Edit/Delete Test Cases or by the Assign Keywords To Multiple Cases. 
Keywords can only be created, edited, or deleted by leads but may be assigned 
to test cases by testers.</p> 

<h2>Build</h2>

<p>Users can filter test cases by builds. Builds are the basic component for 
how test cases are tracked. Each test case may be run once and only once per build. 

<br />Builds can be created by leads using the Create New Build page.</p>


<h2>Result</h2>

<p>Users can filter test cases by results. Results are what happened to that test 
case during a particular build. Test cases can pass, fail, be blocked, or not be run.</p>

<h2>Most Current Result</h2>

<p>By default or if the "most current" checkbox is unchecked, the tree will be sorted 
by the build that is chosen from the dropdown box. In this state the tree will display 
the test cases status. 

<br />Example: User selects build 2 from the dropdown box and doesn't check the "most 
current" checkbox. All test cases will be shown with their status from build 2. 
So, if test case 1 passed in build 2 it will be colored green.

<br />If the user decideds to check the "most current" checkbox the tree will be 
colored by the test cases most recent result.

<br />Ex: User selects build 2 from the dropdown box and this time checks 
the "most current" checkbox. All test cases will be shown with most current 
status. So, if test case 1 passed in build 3, even though the user has also selected 
build 2, it will be colored green.</p>
