<h1>Assign Requirements to Test Case</h1>

<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<p>This feature allows to set relations between requirements 
and test cases. A designer could define relations 0..n to 0..n. I.e. One test case
could be assigned to none, one or more test cases and vice versa.</p>

<h2>Get Started:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Choose an Test Case in tree at the left. The combo box with list of Requirements 
	Specifications is shown at the top of workarea.</li>
	<li>Choose a Requirements Specification. TestLink automatically reload the page.</li>
	<li>A middle block of workarea lists all requirements (from choosen Specification), which 
	are connected with the test case. Bottom block 'Available Requirements' lists all 
	requirements which have not relation
	to the current test case. A designer could mark requirements which are covered by this 
	test case and then click the button 'Assign'. These new assigned test case are shown in 
	the middle block 'Assigned Requirements'.</li>
</ol>
